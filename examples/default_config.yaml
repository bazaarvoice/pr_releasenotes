# Sample configuration containing default values.
# At least one of the following options must be uncommented to use this configuration file
#

# Name of your repo in user/repo format. Defaults to nil and must be overridden in the yaml or on the cmd line.
# repo: 

# Release notes will be pulled from PRs merged to this branch. Defaults to master.
# branch: master

# Tag range from which release notes should be gathered

# Extract pull requests starting from this tag. Defaults to nil for latest published release. Override if
# there are no published releases yet.
# Note: Although this parameter is listed here for completeness, this will likely be specified on the cmd line
# since its value will vary with each release.
# start_tag:

# Defaults to nil for latest commit. nil will also skip the creation of a github release
# end_tag:

# If all your tags have a common prefix, add that here, and use just the varying suffix as the 
# start/end tag arguments. Defaults to blank.
# tag_prefix: 

# Short sha uniqueness threshold. Shas shorter than this may collide with other commits. When searching for
# PRs related to a set of commits, shorter shas means more of them can be added into each query, allowing for
# fewer calls to github search.
# min_sha_size: 7

# Whether to include even PRs not matching the relnotes_regex
# include_all_prs: true

# Finish by posting release notes to github
# github_release: false


# Release notes parsing options. Note that comments will always get stripped

# By default, only the PR titles will be used, so match nothing from the description
# relnotes_regex: '/.\A/'
# To use the entire PR description instead
# relnotes_regex: '/.*/m'

# group to capture from the above regex
# relnotes_group: 0


# Set categorization options

# Set to true to enable categorization
# categorize: false

# Prefix to use to detect categories in the PR description
# category_prefix: '^\* '

# PRs without categories will get included into this default category
# category_default: '<!--99-->Other'

# Add a prefix to the release notes items
# relnotes_hdr_prefix: '* '


# Optional jira url to auto link all strings matching a jira ticket pattern
# Default to nil to skip auto link
# jira_baseurl:


# !!!CAUTION!!! this will auto paginate github api calls, and potentially overrun your rate limits! Do not try 
# to get release notes for all history for your project. Limit to no more than 2-3 pages worth of commits per
# the UI.
# auto_paginate: false
